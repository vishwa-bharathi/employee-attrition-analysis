# 👥 Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition.  
The goal is to provide data-driven insights that help organizations reduce attrition, improve employee retention, and support workforce planning decisions.

The analysis was performed using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

## 🎯 Business Objective
Employee attrition increases hiring costs, reduces productivity, and impacts team stability.  
This project aims to:
- Identify drivers of employee attrition
- Understand which employee groups are most at risk
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve retention

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains employee-level information including:
- Demographics (age, gender, education, marital status)
- Job-related attributes (department, job role, job level)
- Compensation and workload details (monthly income, overtime)
- Tenure and experience
- Attrition status (Yes/No)

The dataset was cleaned and reviewed before analysis.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed using Python to:
- Analyze attrition distribution across departments and job roles
- Study the relationship between tenure and attrition
- Examine the impact of overtime on attrition
- Compare income levels of attrited vs retained employees

EDA helped guide the SQL-based business analysis.

## 🧮 Data Analysis Using SQL
SQL was used to answer key business questions such as:
- What is the overall attrition rate?
- Which departments and job roles have the highest attrition?
- How does tenure affect employee attrition?
- What is the relationship between overtime and attrition?
- Does income level influence attrition?

SQL concepts used:
- Aggregations
- Joins
- Subqueries
- Conditional logic

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
- Overall attrition percentage
- Attrition by department and job role
- Attrition by tenure groups
- Attrition by overtime status
- Employee distribution across key attributes

The dashboard enables quick identification of high-risk employee segments.

---

## 💡 Key Business Insights
- Employees with lower tenure have higher attrition rates
- Overtime is strongly associated with increased attrition
- Certain departments and job roles show consistently higher attrition
- Lower income levels correlate with higher attrition

---

## 📌 Recommendations
- Strengthen onboarding programs for new employees
- Monitor and reduce excessive overtime
- Review compensation strategies for high-attrition roles
- Implement targeted retention plans for at-risk employees
